# SeaBass_parsing

The point of this exercise is to facilitate parsing SeaBASS files.
SeaBASS is a distributed database. To obtain an updated version we have to request files every time and cannot really automate it.(or i don't know how to) 

Important questions: 
What parameters do we need for a project? 
What do we want to do? 
What do we want to save? 

Steps: 
1.Go to https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/search_results/bio (maybe register with earthdata)
2. choose the parameters and submit a request
3. confirm the request in your email and download the data (takes more than 24 hours) 
4. put the seabass on a google disk / server/ local machine
5. run the Seabass.ipynb to choose parameters you need (check that you have SB_support_extended.ipynb file in the path)
6.  save the cvs. 
7.  you can work with cvs in any software (MSExcel, matlab,r, python) 
8.  in this repository i will keep some codes to visualize the chosen parameters
